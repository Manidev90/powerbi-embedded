# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

### `npm run build:<environment>`

Builds the app for production using the environment variables defined in the corresponding `.env` file. \<environment\> can be any of `stg, dev, qa`.

This comes in handy to change PUBLIC_URL, and other
custom logic based on the deploy environment.

See the section about [Adding Custom Environment Variables](https://create-react-app.dev/docs/adding-custom-environment-variables/) for more information.

### `npm run analyze`

Generates a detailed interactive report of every package that contributes to the final bundle size. This is useful to identify parts of the app that could be Lazy Loaded.

This is meant to be run after running `npm run build` or `npm run build:<environment>`.

### `npm run storybook`

Runs the StoryBook component library
Open [http://localhost:6006/](http://localhost:6006/) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm run build-storybook`

Builds Storybook component library for deployment.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
